/**
 * The paper EXECUTION SIMULATOR.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *
 * `paper_touch` records a fill at the touch that was visible in the DETECTION
 * snapshot. That is useful — it isolates the strategy's edge from execution
 * quality — but it is optimistic in a specific, knowable way: it assumes the book
 * is unchanged between spotting a four-leg mispricing and an order reaching the
 * exchange. For a mispricing that exists precisely because someone is about to
 * correct it, that assumption is the whole question.
 *
 * `paper_latency` answers it with evidence instead of a fudge factor:
 *
 *   detection snapshot
 *     → simulated decision/processing delay      (BOX_SIMULATED_DECISION_MS)
 *     → simulated order-send timestamp
 *     → simulated exchange arrival               (BOX_SIMULATED_LATENCY_MS)
 *     → wait for the FIRST WebSocket book each leg publishes at/after arrival
 *     → evaluate the four legs on the books that actually existed then
 *     → measure slippage per leg against the detected touch
 *     → re-qualify on those executed prices
 *     → fill, or refuse with a specific reason
 *
 * There is NO invented slippage percentage anywhere in this module. Every price it
 * records was published by the exchange after the simulated order could have
 * arrived. Correspondingly, if a leg publishes nothing in the wait window there is
 * no evidence of what it would have filled at, so nothing is filled — recorded as
 * `missing_book` rather than quietly reusing the stale detection price.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
 *
 *   - The hot detection path must stay fast. Only candidates that already cleared
 *     qualification enter this pipeline, and each one runs at most once at a time.
 *   - The clock and the sleep are INJECTED, so the whole pipeline is
 *     deterministically testable without real timers.
 *   - Full five-level depth is captured only here (at the fill) and never per
 *     candidate per tick.

   * falsely rejected quiet-but-valid books.
   *
   * So: wait until arrival (we cannot act before the order lands), then read the
   * store's current book per token. Any tick that landed DURING the latency is
   * naturally the current book by then, so an adverse or favourable in-flight move
   * is used automatically. A book that is simply old is judged by the downstream
   * freshness check (age at executedAt vs `quoteMaxAgeMs`), and a token with no
